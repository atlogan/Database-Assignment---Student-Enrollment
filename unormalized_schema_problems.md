Key problems with unnormalized schema:

1. **Data Redundancy**:
   - Student information (name, major, enrollment date) is duplicated for each course they take. For example, John Doe's information appears twice.
   - Course information (name, credits) is repeated for each student enrolled. "Introduction to Programming" appears twice.
   - Instructor information is duplicated. Dr. Smith's details appear twice.

2. **Update Anomalies**:
   - If John Doe changes his major, we'd need to update multiple rows
   - If "Introduction to Programming" changes its name, we'd need to update it in multiple places
   - If Dr. Smith changes departments, we'd need to update all his classes

3. **Insertion Anomalies**:
   - We can't add a new course without having a student enrolled in it
   - We can't add a new instructor without having them teach a class
   - We can't add a new student without them being enrolled in a course

4. **Deletion Anomalies**:
   - If we delete Jane Smith's enrollment in CS101, we might accidentally lose the course information
   - If we delete the last class Dr. Smith teaches, we might lose his instructor information

5. **No Clear Primary Key**:
   - The current design doesn't have a single column that can uniquely identify a row
   - We'd need a combination of student_id, course_id, and class_id to uniquely identify an enrollment

6. **Data Integrity Issues**:
   - There's no way to enforce that a student's information remains consistent across all their enrollments
   - Course information could become inconsistent if updated in some rows but not others
